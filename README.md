### Objective

This project serves as an introduction to reading ML literature, and then applying this knowledge to deep learning and differential privacy concerns. The goal of this project is to understand deep learning models and how to protect the privacy of an individualâ€™s data. Different algorithmic techniques for learning will be implemented on medical image datasets and an analysis of privacy costs within the framework of differential privacy will be completed to evaluate the merits and room for improvement of different techniques. This project deliverable will be a research paper summarizing the results found throughout the fall and winter semesters.

- **Python Scripts**: 
  - `load_dataset_into_pickle.py`: reads a directory of images, transforms the data into Numpy arrays, applies data segmentation and saves into gzip pickle files. 
  - `visualize_dataset.py`: reads a directory of images to create a scatter plot of image size and label distribution. 
  - `metrics_calc_helper_functions.py`: helper functions to calculate metrics for comparison, and to dump the data into text files. 
  - `runtime_and_memory_graphs.py`: generates graphs to compare memory/runtime of all techniques for the chest and knee datasets.
- **Metrics**: 
  - `/metrics/`: stores text files of the metrics from our techniques for both the chest and knee datasets
